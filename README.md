# TASK-3
C++ Implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST) and Min-Heap
Key Accomplishments

Constructed a Binary Search Tree (BST) from a set of data and implemented both post-order and pre-order traversals.
Developed a Min-Heap with methods for insertion and heap construction using the buildHeap algorithm.
Demonstrated a solid understanding of data structures and algorithms through these implementations.
Code Highlights

Utilized C++ classes to define the TreeNode and MinHeap structures.
Implemented recursive functions to handle BST traversals efficiently.
Applied heapify and buildHeap algorithms to construct a functional Min-Heap.
